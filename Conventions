1) all functions that produce a dot format output are called
Dot*Something, and all functions that produce a tikz format output are
called Tikz*Something, these functions are in the files dot.g* and
tikz.g*

2) all the functions return a string, which you can write to a file
using FileString(filename, string); (this makes developing the code
much simpler, and more versatile in the end).

3) we should try to stick to the conventions outlined in the package
development section of the manual. See
http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~alexk/example/doc/chapA.html for a
draft of this guidance. In particular, we should properly declare all
functions.

4) I use 2 spaces as indentation in the code  (this is not so important)

5) I'm using vim and so there are no lines (or few anyway) longer than
80 characters (this too is not so important).

6) Version numbers. The format for version numbers is "0.major.minor". 
The minor number is supposed to be updated whenever some new functionality
added or some existing modified and the corresponding log entry should be 
put in the ChangeLog file and the repository tagged accordingly.
