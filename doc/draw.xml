  <Func Name="Draw" Arg="object,params"/>
  <Description>
 Generic method for visualising the mathematical objects within <C>GAP</C>.
 Currently drawing means that a textfile is produced which is then can postprocessed by another application
 (e.g. <URL Text="GraphViz">http://graphviz.org</URL>, LaTeX).  
 <P/>
 <C>object</C> is the object to be drawn, and method selection decides what actual drawing method is chosen.
 <C>params</C> is a record containing additional parameters for drawing. 
 The  parameter  <C>filename</C> is compulsory.
 Other parameters may encode information on how to draw the graph for an object. These are specific to particular types and
 even for the same type there could be different drawing methods requiring extra parameters (e.g. giving symbols for states instead of integers).
 It is recommended to return the the name of the physical file (i.e. filename + extension) so <Ref Func="Splash"/> can 
 start to corresponding external application.

  <Func Name="Splash" Arg="object, params"/>
  <Description>
 For immediate drawing, i.e. generating a PDF from the GraphViz source and
 starting an external application for viewing the PDF file.  
 An external PDF viewer should be configured properly by setting the <Ref Var="PDF_VIEWER"/> global variable.
 Optional parameters in a record can be passed to the drawing function (for details see <Ref Func="Draw"/>).
